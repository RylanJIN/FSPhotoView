FSPhotoView
===========

FSPhotoView gives the ability to display image in fullscreen by a simple tap on any thumbnail image. The thumbnail image will animated to focused fullscreen image view from its initial position. Another tap on the fullscreen view zooms out the image back to the thumbnail status. This project is an attempt to re-implement the experience of inaction from Sina Weibo/WangYi News timeline to photo browser and to figure out how the animations are done.
